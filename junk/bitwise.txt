/*
    ● &
    a = 5; == 0101
    b = 9; == 1001

    a & b = 0001. because we take one only when all the numbers are 1

    ● |
    a | b = 1101. because whenever we find one then just take one

    ● ^
    a ^ b = 1100. when they're not thesame take 1.

    ● =~
    a =~ a = 0101. because swap 1 with 0

    ● <<
    b << 1 = 0010. basically move the last bit to the give distance

    ● >>
    b >> 1 = 0100. opposite of the above one

    b == 0010
